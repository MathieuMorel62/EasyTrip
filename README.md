#### Data Flow

This diagram illustrates the flow of data in the application, from user interactions to the display of information on the screen.

<img width="1567" alt="Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2024-09-23 aÃÄ 12 28 53" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d418e4d-b543-4aa0-8d8b-c64442e82b56">

#### Description:

- **User:** Interacts with the front-end interface.
- **Front-end:** Sends requests to the back-end when an action is performed (for example, trip creation).
- **Back-end:** Processes requests according to the MVC model, accesses database data and calls external services.
- **Database:** Stores information about users, travel, hotels, etc.
- **External Services:** Enrich travel data with additional information (Google Places, GeoNames, Gemini).
